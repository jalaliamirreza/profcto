**Note to Claude Code:** Please build this as a single, self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. Make it visually impressive, smooth, and professional. Use modern CSS features like gradients, backdrop-filter, animations, and flexbox/grid. Add scroll-triggered animations and hover effects. This needs to WOW the recipient while proving technical capability.
